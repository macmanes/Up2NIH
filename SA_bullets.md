1. This needs to be done so that we can identify the relevant mechanisms that contribute to the phenotype

2. To identify specific genetic pathways

3. To characterize the physiologic and genomic response (differential gene expression, patterns of methylation or isoform use) to extreme water restriction and heat.

4. Test the hypothesis using whole genome gene expression and methylation data from mice subjected to different experimental conditions. 

5. novel mechanisms in desert adapted animals. 

6. We will have identified mechanisms that will be useful in understanding the relevant differences between humans and mice, suggest therapeutic interventions, etc.
